# rock-paper-scissors-thodpr-prototype

This project is an assignment for "The Odin Project" course, focusing on building a Rock Paper Scissors game that can be played entirely from the console. The objective is to create a fun and interactive game where the player competes against the computer in a series of rounds.

The game involves making selections between Rock, Paper, and Scissors, with each selection having a chance of winning, losing, or resulting in a tie. Through this assignment, participants will practice fundamental JavaScript concepts such as functions, conditionals, and randomization.

Happy coding!
